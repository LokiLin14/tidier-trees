# Tidier Trees 

An implementation of the [Tidier Drawings of Trees](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1702828) paper. 

This took an embarrasingly long time (2 days) lol. 

To build on arch you need to install sdl2, sdl2tff, sdl2image, and cmocka (for testing). 
```sh
sudo pacman -S sdl2 sdl2_ttf sdl2_image cmocka
```
